# On Language

v0.1.0

### Coercing ChatGPT to create languages and structured data.

---
### Overview

**On Language** is an experiment in coercing [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to create languages and structured data responses. The languages created can then be used as a direct creative input. [P5.js](https://p5js.org/get-started/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) are directly embedded into this site, but any creative platform could use the returned data.

[Watch the demo](./assets/on-language-do-re-me.mp4) of turning a ChatGPT response into XML and generate a melody using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).
